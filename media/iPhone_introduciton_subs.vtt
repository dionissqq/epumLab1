1
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:16.500
this is a day I've been looking forward

2
00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:19.140
to for two and a half years every once

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.579
in a while a revolutionary product comes

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:29.039
along that changes everything

5
00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:31.018
and Apple has been well first of all

6
00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.239
ones very fortunate if you get to work

7
00:00:31.018 --> 00:00:38.549
on just one of these in your career

8
00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:41.609
apples been very fortunate it's been

9
00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:46.288
able to introduce a few of these into

10
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:50.280
the world 1984 we introduced the

11
00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.689
Macintosh it didn't just change Apple it

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.689
changed the whole computer industry

13
00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:14.430
in 2001 we introduced the first iPod and

14
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.770
it didn't just it didn't just change the

15
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.840
way we all listen to music it changed

16
00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:28.709
the entire music industry well today

17
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:35.868
we're introducing three revolutionary

18
00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:41.000
products of this class the first one is

19
00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:41.000
a widescreen iPod with touch controls

20
00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:56.369
the second is a revolutionary mobile

21
00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:18.259
and the third is a breakthrough internet

22
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:21.290
communications device so three things a

23
00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:23.848
widescreen iPod with touch controls a

24
00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.889
revolutionary mobile phone and a

25
00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:34.378
breakthrough internet communications

26
00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:41.238
device an iPod a phone and an Internet

27
00:02:34.378 --> 00:02:41.239
communicator an iPod a phone

28
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.389
these are not three separate devices

29
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.390
this is one device

30
00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:08.039
and we are calling it iPhone today

31
00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:13.370
today Apple is going to reinvent the

32
00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:13.370
phone and here it is

33
00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.479
now

34
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.370
actually here it is but we're gonna

35
00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:32.680
leave it there for now so before we get

36
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.480
into it let me let me talk about a

37
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.050
category of things the most advanced

38
00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:41.619
phones are called smart phones so they

39
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.100
say and they typically combine a phone

40
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.870
plus some email capability plus they say

41
00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.609
it's the Internet's or the baby internet

42
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.000
in the one device and they all have

43
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.240
these plastic little keyboards on them

44
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.150
and the problem is that they're not so

45
00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.969
smart and they're not so easy to use so

46
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.430
if you kind of make a you know business

47
00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:06.430
school 101 graph of a smart axis and the

48
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.540
easy to use axis phones regular cell

49
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.520
phones are kind of right there they're

50
00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:13.870
not so smart and then they're you know

51
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.310
not so easy to use but smart phones are

52
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.680
definitely a little smarter but they

53
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.139
actually are harder to use they're

54
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.759
really complicated just for the basic

55
00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.579
stuff people have a hard time figuring

56
00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.860
out how to use them well we don't want

57
00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:29.500
to do either one of these things what we

58
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.470
want to do is make a leapfrog product

59
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.379
that is way smarter than any mobile

60
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:42.130
device has ever been and super easy to

61
00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:45.730
use this is what iPhone is okay so we're

62
00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:52.509
gonna reinvent the phone now we're gonna

63
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:57.220
start with a revolutionary user

64
00:04:52.509 --> 00:05:01.719
interface is the result of years of

65
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.370
research and development and of course

66
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.400
it's an interplay of hardware and

67
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.019
software now why do we need a

68
00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:11.079
revolutionary user interface I mean

69
00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:14.589
here's four smartphones right Motorola Q

70
00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:17.409
the BlackBerry palm treo nokia e62 the

71
00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:19.659
usual suspects and what's wrong with

72
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.610
their user interfaces well the problem

73
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.310
with them is really sort of in the

74
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.490
bottom 40 there it's it's this stuff

75
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.439
right here they all have these keyboards

76
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.660
that are there whether you need them or

77
00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:33.189
not to be there and they all have these

78
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.830
control buttons

79
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.569
are fixed in plastic and are the same

80
00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:39.189
for every application well every

81
00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.129
application wants a slightly different

82
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:44.889
user interface a slightly optimized set

83
00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.540
of buttons just for it and what happens

84
00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.250
if you think of a great idea six months

85
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.689
from now you can't run around and add a

86
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.720
button to these things they're already

87
00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:55.060
shipped so what do you do it doesn't

88
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.490
work because the buttons and the

89
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.500
controls can't change they can't change

90
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.750
for each application and they can't

91
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.490
change down the road if you think of

92
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.060
another great idea you want to add to

93
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.879
this product well how do you solve this

94
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:13.449
hmm it turns out we have solved it we

95
00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:16.089
solved it in computers 20 years ago we

96
00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.370
solved it with a bitmap screen that

97
00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:21.729
could display anything we want put any

98
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.480
user interface up and a pointing device

99
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.950
we solved it with the mouse right we

100
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.990
solve this problem so how are we gonna

101
00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.479
take this to a mobile device

102
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.360
well what we're gonna do is get rid of

103
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:39.520
all these buttons and just make a giant

104
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.930
screen a giant screen now how are we

105
00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:42.939
gonna communicate this we don't want to

106
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.060
carry around a mouse right so what are

107
00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:52.199
we gonna do Oh a stylus right we're

108
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:54.370
gonna use a stylus No who wants a stylus

109
00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:57.250
you have to get them and put them away

110
00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.668
and you'll lose them yuck nobody wants a

111
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.589
stylus so let's not use a stylus we're

112
00:07:00.668 --> 00:07:03.579
going to use the best pointing device in

113
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.889
the world we're gonna use a pointing

114
00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:07.060
device that we're all born with were

115
00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.639
born with ten of them we're gonna use

116
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.610
our fingers we're going to touch us with

117
00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:15.129
our fingers and we have invented a new

118
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:20.530
technology called multi-touch which is

119
00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:23.949
phenomenal it works like magic you don't

120
00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:25.869
need a stylus it's far more accurate

121
00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:29.199
than any touch display that's ever been

122
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:32.860
shipped it ignores unintended touches

123
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:36.399
it's super smart you can do multi-finger

124
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.520
gestures on it and boy have we patented

125
00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:38.519
it

126
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.470
so

127
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:51.579
we've been very lucky to have brought a

128
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.350
few revolutionary user interfaces to the

129
00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:58.180
market in our time

130
00:07:53.350 --> 00:08:01.030
first was the mouse the second was the

131
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.910
click wheel and now we're gonna bring

132
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:06.039
multi-touch to the market and each of

133
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:09.160
these revolutionary user interfaces has

134
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:14.340
made possible a revolutionary product

135
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:16.510
the Mac the iPod and now the iPhone so a

136
00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:20.529
revolutionary user interface we're gonna

137
00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:24.759
build on top of that with software now

138
00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:26.099
software on mobile phones is like it's

139
00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:30.699
like baby software

140
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.720
it's not so powerful and today we're

141
00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:33.429
gonna show you a software or

142
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.700
breakthrough software that's at least

143
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:38.918
five years ahead of what's on any other

144
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:42.729
phone now how do we do this well we

145
00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:46.110
start with a strong foundation iPhone

146
00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:46.110
runs OS 10

147
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.820
why

148
00:08:52.909 --> 00:08:58.189
why would we want to run such a

149
00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.500
sophisticated operating system on a

150
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.790
mobile device well because it's got

151
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.820
everything we need

152
00:09:01.789 --> 00:09:07.459
it's got multitasking it's got the best

153
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.990
networking it already knows how to power

154
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.200
manage we've been doing this on mobile

155
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:14.539
computers for years it's got awesome

156
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.450
security and the right apps it's got

157
00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:19.849
everything from cocoa and the graphics

158
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:22.910
and it's got core animation built in and

159
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.950
it's got the audio and video that OS 10

160
00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:27.769
is famous for it's God all the stuff we

161
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:31.420
want and it's built right in to iPhone

162
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:36.289
and that has led us create desktop class

163
00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:38.629
applications and networking right not

164
00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:41.000
the crippled stuff that you find on most

165
00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:44.870
phones this is real desktop class

166
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.480
applications now you know one of the

167
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:49.279
pioneers of our industry Alan Kay has

168
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.649
had a lot of great quotes throughout the

169
00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:54.860
years and I ran across one of them

170
00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:58.340
recently that explains how we look at

171
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.950
this explains why we go about doing

172
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:04.250
things the way we do because we love

173
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:06.650
software and here's the quote people who

174
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:10.159
are really serious about software should

175
00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:11.590
make their own hardware you know Alan

176
00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:14.120
said this thirty years ago

177
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:17.210
and this is how we feel about it and so

178
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.310
we're bringing breakthrough software to

179
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.710
a mobile device for the first time it's

180
00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:24.169
five years ahead of anything on any

181
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.930
other phone the second thing we're doing

182
00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:28.789
is we're learning from the iPod syncing

183
00:10:26.929 --> 00:10:31.329
with iTunes you know we're gonna ship

184
00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:35.419
our hundred millionth iPod this year and

185
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:37.220

iTunes again you go to iTunes and you

206
00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:30.259
set it up just like you'd set up an iPod

207
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:33.259
or an Apple TV and you set up what you

208
00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:36.710
want sync to your iPhone and it's just

209
00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:41.330

211
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.190
to talk about a little is design we've

212
00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:49.579
designed something wonderful for your

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:54.050
hand just wonderful and this is what it

214
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:55.100
looks like it's got a three and a half

215
00:11:54.049 --> 00:11:58.609
inch screen on it

216
00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.350
it's really big and it's the highest

217
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.470
resolution screen we've ever shipped

218
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:05.060
it's a hundred and sixty pixels per inch

219
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.490
highest we've ever shipped it's gorgeous

220
00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:09.049
and on the front there's only one button

221
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.269
down there we call it the home button it

222
00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:14.539
takes you home from wherever you are and

223
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:17.059
that's it let's take a look aside it's

224
00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:20.000
really thin it's thinner than any

225
00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:22.159
smartphone out there at eleven point six

226
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.139
millimeters thinner than the Q thinner

227
00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:27.500
than the Black Jack thinner than all of

228
00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:28.879
them it's really nice and we got some

229
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.379
controls on the side we got a little

230
00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:33.710
switch for ring and silent we've got a

231
00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:36.259
volume up and down control let's look at

232
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.970
the back on the back the biggest thing

233
00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:40.450
of note is we got a two megapixel camera

234
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.450
built right in

235
00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:45.269
the other side and we're back on the

236
00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:48.919
front so let's take a look at the top

237
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:50.759
now we've got a headset jack

238
00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:52.729
three-and-a-half millimeter all your

239
00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:55.259
iPod headphones fit right in

240
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.839
we've got a place a little tray for your

241
00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:59.399
SIM card and we've got one switch for

242
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.879
sleep and wake just push it to go to

243
00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:02.669
sleep

244
00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:07.619
push it to wake up let's take a look at

245
00:13:02.669 --> 00:13:10.110
the bottom we've got a speaker you've

246
00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:13.819
got a microphone and we've got our 30

247
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:16.438
pin iPod connector so that's the bottom

248
00:13:13.818 --> 00:13:19.649
now we've also got some stuff you can't

249
00:13:16.438 --> 00:13:21.688
see we've got three really advanced

250
00:13:19.649 --> 00:13:24.328
sensors built into this phone the first

251
00:13:21.688 --> 00:13:25.948
one is a proximity sensor it senses when

252
00:13:24.328 --> 00:13:27.868
physical objects get close so when you

253
00:13:25.948 --> 00:13:30.479
bring iPhone up to your ear

254
00:13:27.869 --> 00:13:32.428
to take a phone call it turns off a

255
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.350
display and it turns off the touch

256
00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:36.419
sensor instantly why do you want to do

257
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.860
that well one to save battery but two so

258
00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:39.599
you don't get spurious inputs from your

259
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.860
face into the touch screen just

260
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.629
automatically turns them off take away

261
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.129
boom it's back on so it's got a

262
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:46.409
proximity sensor built-in it's got an

263
00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:47.789
ambient light sensor as well we sense

264
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:49.708
the ambient lighting conditions and

265
00:13:47.789 --> 00:13:51.298
adjust the brightness of the display to

266
00:13:49.708 --> 00:13:53.609
match the ambient lighting conditions

267
00:13:51.298 --> 00:13:55.948
again better user experience saves power

268
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:58.438
and the third thing we've got is an

269
00:13:55.948 --> 00:14:01.818
accelerometer so that we can tell when

270
00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:01.818
you switch from portrait to landscape
